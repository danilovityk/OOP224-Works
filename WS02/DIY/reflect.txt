I understood how to perform dynamic memory allocation and prevent memory leaks. I got help from You on part one where I needed to add the '&' sign to pass elements of the array by reference instead of value. I understood how it works, and even if I have to pass the element of the global array I have to pass its address. The hardest thing for me was actually that '&' sign, because I couldn't understand what is wrong with my code for hours.

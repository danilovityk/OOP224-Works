I have been fine throughout the workshop, and it was pretty easy to complete for me.
The explanations of the ideas were straightforward, and the readme.md provided was clear. 
I actually got some practice with operators overloading and that was pretty interesting 
(and i'm not writing random text, that was actually interesting:) ).
